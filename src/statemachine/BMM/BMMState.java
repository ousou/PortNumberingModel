 * State for the BMM state machine.
 * 
 * The state machine will name the states in the following way:
 * 
 * URWO(i) - Unmatched running white odd, round i
 * URWE(i) - Unmatched running white even, round i
 * URBO(i) - Unmatched running black odd, round i
 * URBE(i) - Unmatched running black even, round i
 * MRW(j)  - Matched running white, matched to port j
 * 
 * Stopping states:
 * 
 * USW     - Unmatched stopped white
 * USB     - Unmatched stopped black
 * MSW(j)  - Matched stopped white, matched to port j
 * MSB(j)  - Matched stopped black, matched to port j
